    In my lesson today I learnt how to run the new software I've downloaded.
    
    I also learnt the basics of Github.
    
    There were some complications at points but everything flowed together okay.
    
    I wish I had a second screen.
    
    Mastered a valuable tool liked by employers.
    
    There were some moments I struggled to understand but by the end things came together quite well.
    
    I downloaded two apps to practice coding on my phone but ended up having a long chat with a friend in Canada who works as a frontend developer.

In my lesson today I learnt how to run the new software I've downloaded.

I also learnt the basics of Github.

There were some complications at points but everything flowed together okay.

I wish I had a second screen.

Mastered a valuable tool liked by employers.

There were some moments I struggled to understand but by the end things came together quite well.

I downloaded two apps to practice coding on my phone but ended up having a long chat with a friend in Canada who works as a frontend developer.
