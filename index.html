<h1>1.- 30/09/2020</h1> 

<h2>Reflection</h2>



In my lesson today I learnt how to run the new software I've downloaded.

I also learnt the basics of Github.

There were some complications at points but everything flowed together okay.

I wish I had a second screen.

Mastered a valuable tool liked by employers.

There were some moments I struggled to understand but by the end things came together quite well.

I downloaded two apps to practice coding on my phone but ended up having a long chat with a friend in Canada who works as a frontend developer.

<h2>Reflection - $th Oct</h2>

<h1>3.2. - 13/10/2020</h1>
<h2>Reflection Example</h2>

<p>In today's lesson I found much of it very difficult. Use the CSS you've learnt to jazz it up.

    <p>I re-watched part of the video to try to understand the arithmatic sections but got myself more confused.</p>
    <p>It was good to learn how to do the reflection properly.</p>
<p>I'd like to see about trying to incorprate some html/css/javascript structures in going forward.</p>

<h1>Reflection Sunday 18th October 2020</h1>
I struggled to find the time to re-watch the videos from the previous week but did continue with the M1mo app I've been ticking over with most days.

<em>Also</em><break>
I also went through a great deal of my notes with the many friends I have who work in tech. This included trying to show off my knowledge about how to create objects, although I'm not fully sure if I can do that without putting the script and doc text stuff in before?
I tried to name drop arrays, while loops, strings, for loops and the way dot notation seems to work during a long conversation with a friend who studies computer science but I confused myself massively. I learnt about soemthing called 'Refactoring'.</break>
