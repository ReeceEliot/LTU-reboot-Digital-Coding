<h1>1.- 30/09/2020</h1> 

<h2>Reflection</h2>



In my lesson today I learnt how to run the new software I've downloaded.

I also learnt the basics of Github.

There were some complications at points but everything flowed together okay.

I wish I had a second screen.

Mastered a valuable tool liked by employers.

There were some moments I struggled to understand but by the end things came together quite well.

I downloaded two apps to practice coding on my phone but ended up having a long chat with a friend in Canada who works as a frontend developer.

<h2>Reflection - $th Oct</h2>

<h1>3.2. - 13/10/2020</h1>
<h2>Reflection Example</h2>

<p>In today's lesson I found much of it very difficult. Use the CSS you've learnt to jazz it up.

    <p>I re-watched part of the video to try to understand the arithmatic sections but got myself more confused.</p>
    <p>It was good to learn how to do the reflection properly.</p>
<p>I'd like to see about trying to incorprate some html/css/javascript structures in going forward.</p>
